in his Hall of Fame NBA career Charles
Barkley accumulated 12
546 rebounds but he pulled the ultimate
rebound when he finished playing
equaling maybe even eclipsing his
considerable skills on a basketball
court with his singular talent in a TV
studio
for the last 23 years Barkley has been
delivering witty blunt provocative
opinions on every imaginable topic often
imparted with a smile always imparted
with I don't give a damn if you agree
with me Candor imagine Mark Twain with a
low post game as we first reported in
March despite his lack of a tongue
editor maybe because of it Barkley Now
60 seems cancel proof granted license to
go right up to that mid-court line of
acceptability even to stomp over it
sometimes it's made him more relevant
than ever it's made him dare we say it
an American treasure
the story will continue in a moment
why do you suppose people want to listen
to you
[Laughter]
I think they know that I'm gonna be
honest
I'm gonna be fair
I don't have a hidden agenda
not many people on TV that you can set
out about
what's up everybody what's up
you don't have a chance to win every
year that's one of the biggest lies ever
told
[Music]
60 nights a year Charles Barkley is the
go-to guy on TNT's Inside the NBA I like
this do people like you think our team
sucks I'm like uh yeah I only think that
because they suck a path breaking Emmy
dominating show that makes for riveting
unscripted TV you big dummy
you're fun up there it's just basketball
we're not solving inflation we didn't
just get back from Afghanistan but
you're not a used car salesman either I
mean if the game's no good you'll admit
it oh yeah because the fans ain't stupid
they just saw it if I tell them that was
a good game they're gonna be like what
the hell is Charles talking about you
said sometimes you've even fallen asleep
on the set oh I fall asleep man like
just sitting there watching like oh man
this is just bad basketball you know I'm
gonna raise some hell around here this
is what America has come to expect from
Charles Barkley we have to talk about
the Lakers the Lakers are awful for
Chuck it's just I'm going to let it fly
and if you don't like it tough
five four
Ernie Johnson is the longtime host of
Inside the NBA Charles is down there
well how many times do you say we're oh
where's this going we'll start a show
and Charles will look at me and say I
got to get something off my chest
it could be something that involves a
world peace or the Brooklyn Nets or it
could be something he could be upset
that his plumber showed up late and he
just has to get it off his chest we got
to be serious on this show sometime but
if Barkley brings levity he also brings
gravity
Memphis Grizzly Star John Morant was
suspended in March after this Instagram
live video showed him flashing a gun at
a strip club Barkley used it to make a
broader Point guns especially in the
black community the way we killing each
other it's just really unfortunate and
sad and we got to it's always been a
problem but it seemed like it's gotten
worse in the last few years black on
black crime and the way we've been
killing each other Barkley may be at his
most visible in the studio in Atlanta
but for a fuller sense of the man head
two hours West to his hometown of Leeds
Alabama
I'm telling y'all I did not name the
street after myself
you didn't Lobby for Charles Dickens for
Charles Barkley Avenue
we interviewed Barkley in the home he
still keeps in town
it's a few hundred yards from where he
grew up you were angry that your dad
left the family when you were one years
old I was very angry
and I was even angrier because he kept
saying he was going to send us money
and he didn't do it because like you
know my Mom and Grandma were working
their behinds off and the thing that was
really bad about it I was stand by the
uh mailbox like once every three or four
months waiting for the checks yes but
they never came his indomitable Grandma
Johnny may who helped raise him still
inspires stories when Charles and his
buddies get together in Leeds shoot
granted was the real deal
really yeah yeah
and she had one too so we were really
poor we didn't know it at the time so to
make ends meet
she sold alcohol where
in the house had a shot house out of
your house yeah so people would come
over Friday and Saturday and play cards
everybody starts drinking once somebody
lose their money there's gonna be a
fight so my grandmother's little old
lady she's walking around with a sex
shooter and she's keeping the peace
I didn't even know any better John I
thought this was normal stuff
well yeah
I think it's time for a new floor
Barkley also took us to his old Junior
High Gym it stands barely as a symbol of
how far he's come 14 15 year old Charles
Barkley walking in here who's that kid
he's uh five nine five ten big boned not
Pat big boned chubby whatever words you
want to use I'm a 510 backup point guard
you remember specific plays and shots
from playing here Ty game we got you on
the wing yeah it's a tie game I'm not
going to be in the game let's get that
let's get that out the way a six inch
growth spurt helped turn Barkley into a
high school basketball star
but his formative teenage experience
came at the school football stadium wow
this is where he stood alone at a
distance watching his classmates
graduate I flunked Spanish
so I didn't graduate I was at home all
by myself devastated
and I drove around the back side here
and I stood here for two hours and
watched the graduation
I cried the whole time
even now it's kind of hit me in a in the
heart a little bit man what a traumatic
night that was you remember the name of
the teacher I miss Gomez I'll never
forget that and Miss Gomez when I go
back and think was one of the sweetest
kindest people
I'd ever met in my life but in that
moment I was so mad
because you know I wanted to throw my
hat in the air too he graduated thanks
to summer school
at Auburn he was a star yes for his
skills but also for his heroic appetite
he embraced his nickname the round mound
of rebound
drafted in 1984 he became a charismatic
NBA star for the Philadelphia 76ers
he's the shortest man ever to lead the
NBA in rebounding proof that for all
Barkley's Yachts he played with Fury
I was playing to stick it to my dad Miss
Gomez and some of the kids who had made
fun of me instead of just wanting to be
great at basketball what's firing up
this furnace is the anger you have for
your Spanish teacher that flunked you
yes and your dad yes 100 what caused you
to flush out this anger and get
motivated for a different reason the
spin incident in New Jersey in 1991 he
spat at a Heckler and inadvertently hit
a young girl he calls it the low point
of his career I got suspended rightfully
so I was sitting in my hotel room
and I was like
you are
The Biggest Loser in the world
I I remember saying this is it tonight
anyone I am only going to play
basketball because I'm great at it and I
love to play I'm getting all the dirt
off my shoulders Miss Gomez bye Dad bye
that was really the turning point for me
Barkley was the NBA's MVP in 1993 for
the Phoenix Suns
and then months after retiring in 2000
he embarked on a broadcasting career
number one there's no dominant team full
disclosure you may have seen him on this
network working March Madness
what do you make of the college game
today it's a travesty and a disgrace
I'm so mad now how we can mess up
something that's so beautiful and we
mess it up we can't pay
all these players
translation Barkley hates the new wild
west of college sports where players go
to the schools that can bid the highest
in the next three to five years we're
going to have 25 schools that's going to
dominate the sports because they can
afford players
and these schools who can't afford or
won't pay players are going to be
irrelevant
almost a quarter Century since Barkley
last played and now for my opinion his
opinions free of varnish still matter
does Kevin Durant a great great player
if you ain't driving the bus don't walk
around talk about Julia Champion his
takes don't always go over well Kevin
Durant to Perennial All-Star one said of
Barkley I don't know why they still ask
for this idiot's opinion Kevin Durant
he's very sensitive
great player he's part of that
generation who think he can't be
criticized
he's never looked in the mirror and says
man was that a fair criticism
we're in agreement today's players are a
little more sensitive to criticism than
yours that would be an understatement
today's players take offense but so if
players from your generation it's been
been a while since you and Michael
Jordan spoke Michael disagreed with
something I said and he broke off the
Friendship born three days apart Barkley
and Jordan were once the best of friends
but as Jordan struggled as owner of the
Charlotte Hornets Barkley mints no words
and what I said I think that he don't
have enough people around him are going
to tell him
no
and he got really offended
and we haven't spoken but John I really
I'm gonna do my job because I have zero
credibility
if I criticize other people in the same
boat
and not criticize my best friend even if
you have nothing to apologize for you
think of just picking up the phone and
trying to repair this thing with Michael
I got an ego too John
you can't be great at something like you
that doesn't get it right to be a jerk
you think you'll resolve this eventually
he got my number
if you really want to get Barkley going
on disappointment ask him about his
daughter Cristiano's basketball skills
your daughter's not a basketball player
that was
that was brutal
she was six feet tall from from birth
[Laughter]
I'm gonna have the best female
basketball player in the world
I can't wait to she's old enough I'm
gonna teach her everything
and then we start playing and I'm
sitting in the stands and I'm saying to
myself oh man
she is not aggressive at all
so I asked her one day I said you don't
like basketball do you she's all dead I
hate basketball
and I said oh okay
and it took me a little while to get
over that because you're being serious
now yeah but she's a great person and a
straight A student so I had to brag
about that I guarantee that makes you
feel every bit as good as her hitting a
game-winning jumper not quite but it's
close enough
Christiana now 34 recently had a son
Henry the new grandpa says he's never
felt Joy like this when we arrived he
broke out this video
it is by far and away the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me in my life
lives up to the hype it lives up to the
hype I want to spend time with him
because
I'm not morbid I'm not upset
I'm on the back nine I hope I'm gonna
hold 10 or 11. but you never know I
could be on 17 and 18. so I want to
spend as much time with him as possible
and then when he gets older I want him
to Google me Google me kid yeah do you
know who I am I hope he does some
research on me I'll be long gone but I
would like him to know that I
accomplished some things in my life
I got to live my dream Charles Barkley
on gratitude if you think I'm better or
I work harder you're just stupid at 60
minutes overtime.com
