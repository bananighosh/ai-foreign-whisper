{"text": " Rich Paul has become one of the premier agents in professional sports. He counts LeBron James as a close friend and client. The agency he founded, Clutch Sports Group, made deals worth almost $900 million this past summer for his NBA clients alone. Paul honed his deal making instance as a kid, navigating what he called the hostile streets of his Cleveland neighborhood. Today at 42, he's rewriting the playbook for representing pro athletes. Rich Paul told us he was lucky and when you hear his story, we think you will understand why. The story will continue in a moment. So, did you succumb to games when you were younger? I went one time when I had to sit all the way up at the top and really couldn't see the person. And now, now is now, you're sitting on the floor. We joined Rich Paul court side at a Cleveland Cavaliers game last season. He seemed to know everyone. Good. And it seemed everyone wanted to know him. Thank you so much, Tom. Thank you, Ray. Last year, Paul got Cleveland star Darious Garland, a $200 million deal, the richest in franchise history. Garland is one of nearly 200 athletes on Paul's roster. Who were some of the big names that we would all recognize? Which sport you want? I mean, we just had Jane Hurtz and Devonta Smith playing Super Bowl for the Philadelphia Eagles. And then you got the anti-davis and the Dreymind Graves and obviously LeBron. Do you know the total value of the contract you've negotiated? I would say it's close to $3 billion. I think. It's more than $4 billion, but it's hard to keep track when you're always on the go. Showtime, baby. Before the NBA draft in New York City, we watched him work the phones. You know, it's draft day, but anything can happen. Work the room. Hey, Coach, how you doing? How you doing, yeah? And work the angles to move clients like Duke Center, Derek Lively II, up the draft board. Ready? In college, Lively was known for his defense, but Paul had him work on his three-point shot and before the draft invited teams to see. Lively shot up to the 12th pick, about 10 spots higher than first projected. It might not look like it, but Rich Paul is a towering figure in the NBA. I've always been the smallest guy in the room. We'll need to take the biggest swing. Some of his biggest swings have been for his biggest client, LeBron James. Paul negotiated his jumps from Miami to Cleveland to LA deals that netted James $400 million and set him up to win two of his four championships. He told us he works to give players leverage. Some people say that you're destroying the player loyalty to the teams and the fans. Player loyalty to what? If I could be trained in the middle of the night to another team, what I should be is educating myself to where if this isn't going the way I thought it was supposed to go, I can switch up. We're not concerned. I have up. What's this to have in money when no options? That's apparently how superstar Anthony Davis felt in 2018. The New Orleans Center had a $127 million contract but was tired of losing, so he fired his agent and hired Rich Paul. Paul flouted NBA rules by publicly demanding a trade, earning the wrath of fans and a $50,000 fine for Davis. The drama landed Paul on the cover of Sports Illustrated, which called him the most polarizing figure in the NBA. When it was someone that didn't look like me, it was genius. It was why you get a power agent. But when it's me, I'm destroying the league. I mean, those things are absurd. He got Davis what he wanted, a championship ring, and a deal now worth $270 million. There's a saying that goes, if you're a guy, no hate is you ain't poppin'. He must be poppin'. I think I'm poppin' a little bit, you know. He was poppin' a lot at his annual All-Star Game Party this past winter in Salt Lake City. We dropped in and saw giants of the court mingling with wrappers, team owners, and titans of industry over cocktails and canopies. Rich Paul had a full plate of business options, one from the president of Gatorade. I want to be a first call. Done. While we were chatting with him, today, Golden State Warrior, Dreyman Green, cut in. The four-time NBA Champion, cycled through two other agents before signing up with Rich Paul, who landed him a $100 million contract over the summer. So then you end up a young black man who's made more money than you can ever imagine, but you don't know how to live with it. You don't know what to do with it. And what does he do? Most agents treat athletes as if the athlete worked for them, but there's a multi-a-million dollar business going on around most athletes that they don't understand, but they don't have a responsibility to teach them. And that's what's special about it. Paul's improbable journey, the subject of his new memoir out this week, started on the east side of Cleveland in the early 1980s, just as crack cocaine hit the streets. When he was about four, he learned his mother, Manerva, was hooked on crack. His father, Big Rich, recognized his son's intelligence and kept him close, though they lived apart. He owned the neighborhood convenience store. Through death stores, just right in here. Yeah. And this was my world. This now empty corner was a hotbed of activity, legal and illegal. It was a shootout right here on this corner. Big Rich taught his son to always think two steps ahead. He scraped together the money to send him to a Catholic high school away from the neighborhood. Still, there was no avoiding the streets. You don't know what you're in, that's your norm. That's my norm. I started in, Dr. Ken. That was today's version of tuna tartar on the wall door rooftop. This was my education, though. This was my Harvard, my Michigan, it's my more house. And the same things I learned on this corner. I take it to the boardroom. Because the one thing this teaches you that I don't think you can learn from those institutions is people, characters. And on these streets, it's no better way to learn character because they come with everything. His dad taught him another skill, a way to make money of all else fails with a pair of dice. Paul and his best friend Edward Gibbons were regulars that an open-air casino in the park. 50 people crowded around this little area and energy was high. It was an arena. And Rich Paul was a natural. And how much would you earn? I mean, a slow day was a thousand dollars. And a not slow day? A! No, four or five. Four or five thousand dollars. Yes. You were 14, 15, 16. Oh yeah. What did you learn from this experience? You gained a resilience here. We won majority of the time. But you also had to learn how to lose. He suffered his biggest loss when he was 19. His father died from cancer. And Paul went all in on the streets, selling marijuana and crack cocaine. This is the very drug that your mother was hooked on. The absence of my dad allowed me to take that step because I would have never done that. Had he been around. I had too much respect for him. And it's not something that I would sit here and glorify. It almost sounds like you were full-time hustler. Oh yeah. But Jeff Bezos is a hustler. Think he's not. Phil Knight was the ultimate hustler. The difference is they could go with their plan and their business idea and get someone to believe in them. And it didn't matter what idea I had. Just no pathway to get there. He found one through a stroke of luck at the Akron Canton airport. In 2001, Paul was wearing a throwback jersey like this one that caught the eye of another traveler. High school hoops and satian, LeBron James. What did you see in him? I mean, began with him. When a throwback jersey that I loved, but as we got to talk about sports, we started evolving and even talking more and more just about life and about our upbringing and about our moms and our communities and stuff with that nature. And it just kind of struck a court. When James entered the NBA, he hired Rich Paul as a right hand man. Paul went on to work for LeBron's agent and watched, listened and learned. I understand that you would go into meetings with the likes of Warren Buffett. And in those rooms is much better to listen than to talk. If you listen, you might actually learn something and you start to kind of work your way on your own. After just four years, he struck out on his own and launched clutch sports group in 2012. LeBron James went with him. When you first started this, you were underestimated. That only was out underestimated. I was also not wanted. I didn't look like the success in our industry, especially from a place of decision making. And I wanted to disrupt the industry. I wanted to be impactful, but I wanted to come from a place of purpose. In 2013, with his first negotiation as agent for Phoenix Sun's Guard Eric Bledso, he proved the Naceaers' wrong. He said the Suns had offered $28 million. And then $48 million. You turned it down. Yeah. But what was on the line? My career? Everyone was calling and saying, he's crazy. He don't know what he's doing. He's an experienced. It sounds like you are really comfortable, rolling the dice. I was born a dice roller. His gamble paid off. After hanging tough for a year, clutch got Bledso a $70 million deal. Pretty 2 million more than the Sun's first offer. Great room. Today, clutch has 70 employees with offices in Los Angeles, New York and Atlanta. And they both in the same draft class. Paul teamed up with powerhouse agency, UTA, to expand clutch's reach. I had to build a multi-hundred million dollar company to get people to believe in me. And they're still down. Critics say he's only successful because of his relationship with you. I mean, is disappointing to hear that? Would you give him an opportunity? Yeah, and I don't give people opportunity much. And he took, well, the way beyond what he even imagined. Rich Paul now has a new balance signature shoe. A first for an agent. His partner is more famous than he is. He's been in a relationship with Adele for two and a half years. Adele. He gave him a shoutout at the Grammys. Oh, God, Rich, he said, don't cry. If you win anything tonight, don't cry. And here I am crying. A couple of weeks later, at his all-star game party, Paul's friends recognized his achievements. Plus, he is for us. With a $140,000 watch. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Do you have to pinch yourself sometimes? All the time. I had it worse than a lot of people, but I've all done mature, transition. How's that feel? Feels great. It feels earned. You know, it wasn't given for sure. It was earned, which is good.
